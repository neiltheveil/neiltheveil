        hi,, my name's Brandy,
          Im a 14 year old drawing enthusiast.
             I like reading stuff with pictures.
               I consider myself a pansexual butch,
                  my pronouns are strictly they/them.
                   I cherish those around me very greatly.
                    I am single, but not necessarily looking for a relationship.
                      Always free to cuddle or hide, i dont really mind at all.
                       Make sure to use tone tags around me,, i tend to
                        sometimes take things harder than they should.
                          Please don't interact if youre a proshipper, or anything weird.
                                  My moods can vary, im considered to be on the bipolar spectrum.
                                    I dont take confrontations well, be patient with me, at least.
                                      Don't call me Neil, Luci, Lucian, Shin, or Claud, i will block you.
